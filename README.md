## How to run it locally.

You will need to have ```node.js``` installed from version 16 onwards and have access to a terminal to follow the next steps:

1. We enter the folder we just cloned and install the necessary dependencies.
```
npm install
#
yarn
```
>
2. We run our project locally.
```
npm dev
#
yarn dev
```
